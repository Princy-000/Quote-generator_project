This is a quote generator.On the Ui it displays a quote and a button to enarte that quote.each time you press a button it displays a quote and the name of the person who authored the quote
on the background it has a beatiful picture of an old library which i attached through css using url.
to build the code i first designed the code using pseudocode of how i want the code to work.
i then created the html which consisted of the div for the quote generator input and button.
i then used css to style buttons and other content of the html code.i used border box for my box sizing.
for javascript, i used document.querySelector to grab classes and create variables for the quote,the button and person.
i then used an array to store the different quotes and author.
i then used the add event listener object to create a function than would pick a quote using the math.random function and display this quote whenever the button is pressed.
